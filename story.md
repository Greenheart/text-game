# Story

### Game Title Ideas
- The Responsible
    - This could imply several meanings:
        - That you are responsible for the actions you've taken
            - That you are responsible for helping your friend and proved that you took responsibility by helping him
            - For the same reason, except for helping the world.
        - This responsibility of yours could also be the solace after any of the bad endings:
            - You can't be responsible for your friend's life
            - Or the company's actions either for that matter
        - Finally, it could imply the responsibility of the company:
            - For developed and designed the device.
            - And, for their unethical methods of testing it.

### Intro (Cinematic-like)
- Maybe use a interactive section, revealing one part at a time.
- Make this introduction viewable multiple times from some kind of main menu.

### Intro part 1

- *NOTE*: Make sure the pacing of the intro is sufficient. A too slow game is not engaging enough for most players.

In a time of great technological advances, life is less about knowing the answers, but more about asking the right questions.

This is a story to make you think. See beyond the words and look at the meaning of the bigger picture. With some patience, you might be surprised of what you'll find ahead.

- Button: "So how do I play this?"

This game really has two parts:
1. Exploring the world around you
2. Choosing how you want to interact

To control what happens, you type your action and press enter.
For now, everything you need to get started are these basic actions:
- movement
- use
- take / drop
- read

To make the gameplay more convenient, there are features like a *command history* which help you re-use what you've already typed.

- In instructions, tell players about how information is displayed.
    - **bold** for directions and some (but not all!) actions. For the other actions, think about what items are around you and how you could interact with them. Or use the `inspect [object]` command to get the answer.
    - *italics* for items that can be interacted with.

This is an exploration of interactive storytelling. Of how to make characters and environments feel more alive through text. Instead of fancy graphics, this game uses one of the best renderers there are; the human imagination.

- When the player "realizes" he's not there (by completing their first task)
    - Sofa (TV) room is unlocked
    - make player go there and watch TV

- Player watches the news, where they discuss something that reveals a clue.
- TV reveals clues

    - Digital photo frame
        - Reveal memories, discuss backstory for those players that are interested.
        - This also implies that the friend has memory problems. He tries to remember old times through the few photos he actually kept, but still has trouble seeing anything more except the images themselves.

#### Actions
- Answer the phone in the friend's apartment.

#### Tasks?

        - "The applications of this technology is just beyond our imagination. It will change everything!"
        - "Okay, but what is it?"
        - "Sorry, I'm not allowed to tell you any more."
        - "Ah, I imagine a big company is very secretive about such a thing?"
        - "Indeed they are. However, I look forward to share more exciting updates with you in the future"

### Backstory, expand on news reports, background thoughts etc.
- This takes place in the player's apartment.
    - Living room - interact with the TV to watch the news
        - The player thinks "maybe my friend comes soon, it's close to dinner time. I'll watch some TV meanwhile."
        - The news come on, and they talk about a new report. "Wonder what that's about. I don't think my friend minds if I borrow his computer."
    - Desktop - Use the computer to search for more information about the study.
        - "Login screen" - The friend is so careful with security, yet he don't have any password for his home computer. "Imagine what a burglar, just walking into his open apartment could do. Hehe..."
- A group of researchers report that they've made a huge breakthrough in how the human mind works.
- They hope to cure some disease thanks to this research and experts praise the research.

- However, the player can, if they examine details in this environment, learn that the research was funded by the big company, and performed by researchers.

### A later conversation with the friend
- The friend reached out to the player - they feel ill and want to talk - but can't really talk.

- The player might start to suspect that the company is abusing their friend.
- The friend: "I'm fine. They just connect me a couple of days per week. It's not that dangerous."
    - "You do see how this job is affecting you right?"
    - "Relax, I get paid well! And I get to see this new technology before anyone else It's truly amazing once you see how much you can use it for!"
    - "But what are you going to do with all your money? Buy meaningless stuff that you can't even use with your shaky hands?"
    - The friend gets angry and ends the conversation, feeling that they don't get any support - not even from their best friend. And so they start to turn against the player, preventing them from helping their best friend.
- The player starts to form their opinion about how the company operates and what they are working on. They also might start to think that the best friend needs help.

### The realization
- The company runs an ad for a new brain-computer interface
    - "Imagine having all the world's information just a thought away, at any time. Imagine needing no more servers or computers in your daily lives. Just use this device. This will change everything."

    - The player connects this ad to what they've learned about their friend.
        - When the thought hit them, they just stop and drop everything on the ground.
        - "Oh wow! My friend sure is in danger..."
        - "And how is this company getting away with this? How is no one reacting!?"

    - The player also sees several posts on social media - several of his friends have already bought their own devices.
        - He tries to talk them out of it, but they just dismiss him as a "tinfoil hat"- "Relax, it's going to be alright! Something like this surely is tested extensively!"
        - At which point the player can see the connection to their friend(s).

    - Now the player needs to make a choice, how to go about solving these problems
        - Either save the best friend first - or stop the company
        - Maybe do both? Maybe this can only be done if everything happens in the correct order - and fast enough according to the in game time.

- In the end, the player realizes that the company is developing a device that connects to people's brains.
    - It makes them lose their minds gradually, but slow enough for them not to notice it themselves. The device might be planting thoughts into their minds to control them. This way, users think that they gain the benefits of a literally "mind blowing" technology - even though it's ultimately at their own expense.
    - The "Server less architecture" used by the system seems to be linked to the fact that the devices are connected all the time.
        - The user's brains are used as servers. Users become like mindless drones, controlled by the company through their system.
    - They used young, enthusiastic people to test the device before release.
        - Your friend was in kind of a bad spot, and didn't have much of a choice but to accept the offer - or was just really grateful for the "opportunity to test something cutting-edge" and best of all, to get an apartment and other benefits as part of the deal.

- Message of this whole game
    - Be critical of new technology - It's okay to be excited - but don't just accept things (because you're a diehard fan boy with extreme brand loyalty).
    - We need open discussions if we want a healthy relationship with technology.

- Maybe this would fit like an **after-thought provoking section after the game is completed**?

```In a time of great technological advances, it's increasingly important to be aware of how devices and services that we use influence us. At the same time, it's increasingly harder to get this awareness. Perhaps it's even overwhelming to the point where it's hard to see where to start.

Regardless of which, the best one could do is probably to start with something small. Ask questions when you interact with technology. "Why was this designed the way it is?", "Who created this?", "What are their intentions behind this design?".

In a time of great technological advances, we need to be aware of design. But above all: Who's responsible? Let's discuss the ethics of technology. Let's be responsible for what we create.

Now go ahead and ask questions. Awareness comes from questioning the world around us.```
