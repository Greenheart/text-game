        - "Sorry, I'm not allowed to tell you any more."

### A later conversation with the friend
- The friend reached out to the player - they feel ill and want to talk - but can't really talk.

- The player might start to suspect that the company is abusing their friend.
- The friend: "I'm fine. They just connect me a couple of days per week. It's not that dangerous."
    - "You do see how this job is affecting you right?"
    - "Relax, I get paid well! And I get to see this new technology before anyone else It's truly amazing once you see how much you can use it for!"
    - "But what are you going to do with all your money? Buy meaningless stuff that you can't even use with your shaky hands?"
    - The friend gets angry and ends the conversation, feeling that they don't get any support - not even from their best friend. And so they start to turn against the player, preventing them from helping their best friend.
- The player starts to form their opinion about how the company operates and what they are working on. They also might start to think that the best friend needs help.

### The realization
- The company runs an ad for a new brain-computer interface
    - "Imagine having all the world's information just a thought away, at any time. Imagine needing no more servers or computers in your daily lives. Just use this device. This will change everything."

    - The player connects this ad to what they've learned about their friend.
        - When the thought hit them, they just stop and drop everything on the ground.
        - "Oh wow! My friend sure is in danger..."
        - "And how is this company getting away with this? How is no one reacting!?"

    - The player also sees several posts on social media - several of his friends have already bought their own devices.
        - He tries to talk them out of it, but they just dismiss him as a "tinfoil hat"- "Relax, it's going to be alright! Something like this surely is tested extensively!"
        - At which point the player can see the connection to their friend(s).

    - Now the player needs to make a choice, how to go about solving these problems
        - Either save the best friend first - or stop the company
        - Maybe do both? Maybe this can only be done if everything happens in the correct order - and fast enough according to the in game time.

- In the end, the player realizes that the company is developing a device that connects to people's brains.
    - It makes them lose their minds gradually, but slow enough for them not to notice it themselves. The device might be planting thoughts into their minds to control them. This way, users think that they gain the benefits of a literally "mind blowing" technology - even though it's ultimately at their own expense.
    - The "Serverless architecture" used by the system seems to be linked to the fact that the devices are connected all the time.
        - The user's brains are used as servers. Users become like mindless drones, controlled by the company through their system.

- Message of this whole game
    - Be critical of new technology - It's okay to be excited - but don't just accept things (because you're a diehard fan boy with extreme brand loyalty).
    - We need open discussions if we want a healthy relationship with technology.
