        <p>Earlier today, [Y corp], known for their popular suite of web services provided free of charge, revealed their latest project.</p>
        <p>It was at their yearly tech conference [Y thou], that the [Y corp] CEO Isaac Belmont announced the new [X product]. Let's watch the announcement..."</p></i>`

        To make it happen, we realized the world needs to be connected in a smarter way than we are today.</p>

        <p>The internet made it easy to share information, but ultimately divided us more than ever.
        Since merely sharing information isn't enough, we developed the new [X product] to help people connect on a whole new level.</p></i>
        <p>The CEO raises his hand, showing a small chip.</p>

        <i><p>Here it is: a tiny computer that is implanted into the neck in seconds. It connects your brain directly to the internet, and to all the people around the world.</p>
        <p>This not only gives instant, convenient access to information - it lets you really understand the people around you.<p></i>`

        text: `<i><p>But this is not all. New technology is traditionally only available to some parts of the population.
        That's why we will give the new [X product] away for free, to any person, anywhere on the planet. Oh, and we're starting today!</p>

        <p>Come and join us at any of our launch events around world to learn more, and get your own device.
        The first million people to get theirs will also get lifelong premium memberships to all other [Y corp] services.</p>

        <p>Let's connect your future - and bring the world together!"</p></i>`

        <p>This device has clearly done something to my friend.</p></i>

        <p>There's an expert panel gathered in the studio, discussing the announcement. Maybe they know more.</p>`

IDEA: Possibly add something about how well it's been tested.

NOTE: Let's connect YOUR future - or OUR future?
