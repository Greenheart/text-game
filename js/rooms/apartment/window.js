    // IDEA: Add 2-3 notes here?
    // This could be used to describe how Kevin was trying to connect his experiences, to understand what was happening.

    // IDEA:
    // - Kevin signed a contract that he can't get out of.
        // 	- Either you, as the player help him, or you try save the world, or you try to do both!
        // 	- Because of the memory issues, he might not even remember the contract.

    // - In these notes, he explain how he at first was excited about the work. But at a later time, he lost that enthusiasm.

    // - Kevin witnessed another employee who had gone through the whole process - and he was scared.
    	// - The results on the weren't favourable.
    	// - Before he lost his mind, he choose to contact someone.
    	// 	- Maybe they get involved in the story and play a part.
    	// - The company might have picked up on this, trying to reach out to Kevin.
    // IDEA: Maybe write something about the outside, seen through the window?
